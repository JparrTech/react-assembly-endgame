# React Assembly Endgame
Code your way to victory in this high-stakes twist on classic word games. In Assembly Endgame, your mission is to decode the hidden word letter by letter‚Äîbut choose wisely. Each incorrect guess doesn't just cost you a turn; it erases an entire programming language from existence. How many languages will survive your journey to solve the puzzle? Test your lexical skills and save the foundations of coding before they vanish into the digital void.

## What I learned:
Assembly Endgame represents the culmination of my journey through the Scrimba React course on Coursera. Unlike guided assignments, this capstone challenged me to independently transform a comprehensive Figma design into a fully functional web application.

Beyond mastering CSS styling techniques, this project deepened my understanding of React's core architecture. I developed crucial skills in implementing complex game logic through React's ecosystem of states, components, props, and event handlers. The process of methodically breaking down a sophisticated design into modular, interactive components proved to be an invaluable learning experience.

This capstone served as the perfect bridge between structured learning and independent development, reinforcing my confidence in tackling React-based challenges. The skills acquired during this project have established a solid foundation that I'm eager to leverage in my future development work.
